# ChineseChess - C++

Why I reinventing the wheel ?<br>
~~Because I can learn a lot from it.<br>~~
Because I want.<br>

It's my first time to write this, please be merciful, and told me how can it be better.<br>
and also, please be merciful about my English (sorry about maybe sometimes impolite)<br>
~~I want to die.~~

## Introduction

### Progress
- [ ] Plan to achieve Board, Pieces, rules, etc by C++. I'm working on it.
- [ ] Plan to make other user play with you by inside HTTP service. I only think about this.



### Now we have
 - Basic data structures of Board and Pieces but still improving.
 - A man think about how to achieve the Rules may be in Board.
 - Can be constructe with CMake
 - Although I don't have recognition, I think maybe I have a good coding (I guess)



### Compiler method
**This Project can be constructed by CMake ~~which I have experience for about 30 minutes~~ and It's support C++14**<br>
~~If my memory wasn't wrong~~
```bash
git clone ${TODO: add url}
cd ChineseChess
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```



### Running method
Just running it.<br>
```bash
./ChessGame
```
